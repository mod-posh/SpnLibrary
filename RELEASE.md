# Initial Release

Currently, this module is a single monolithic file with no manifest and only in-help, and it is challenging to make changes without affecting the entire module. I will be modernized over the subsequent several iterations to bring it in line with the rest of the PowerShell modules I write. This first release focuses on breaking the module into discreet script files, adding external help, and establishing the repo structure that aligns with my current practices.
